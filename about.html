        <h2>Our Journey in Photography</h2>
        <p>
            Lights and Lens began as a passion project by a small group of photography enthusiasts who wanted 
            to share the art and science of photography with beginners. Over time, our community has grown 
            into a hub for aspiring photographers to learn, connect, and master their craft.
