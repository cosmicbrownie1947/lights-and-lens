When first clicking on the page, the homepage should
pop up. Currently only the blog page and the about
page are working. I am working to add pictures and 
fix the small details I just wanted to see if this
was a good start.
The homepage is index.html
The blog page is blog.html
The About us page is about.html
The style sheet is style.css

This update added more pages to the blog page. Now
when visiting the page you are able to click on the
article pages and read the article. The gear page is 
now also active which allows you to shop gear with
ative Amazon links. The page still is not up to par
where I want it but my next update will be stylizing
and adding character to the page to bring it to life.
It will also include images and font stylizing. I
wanted to get the pages done first before going into
the style of the page.

This is the final update of my page. All four of the 
top buttons work, along with the two articles on the 
Blog page. This update mainly focused on the styling
of everything and adding the images. while it took
some work it definitely got there! My main sturggle 
was keeping the css orderly in order to make sure that
the pages were all cohesive and still worked.
