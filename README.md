When first clicking on the page, the homepage should
pop up. Currently only the blog page and the about
page are working. I am working to add pictures and 
fix the small details I just wanted to see if this
was a good start.
The homepage is index.html
The blog page is blog.html
The About us page is about.html
The style sheet is style.css
