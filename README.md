When first clicking on the page, the homepage should
pop up. Currently only the blog page and the about
page are working. I am working to add pictures and 
fix the small details I just wanted to see if this
was a good start.
The homepage is index.html
The blog page is blog.html
The About us page is about.html
The style sheet is style.css

This update added more pages to the blog page. Now
when visiting the page you are able to click on the
article pages and read the article. The gear page is 
now also active which allows you to shop gear with
ative Amazon links. The page still is not up to par
where I want it but my next update will be stylizing
and adding character to the page to bring it to life.
It will also include images and font stylizing. I
wanted to get the pages done first before going into
the style of the page.
