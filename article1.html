        <h2>Create Stunning Photos</h2>
        <p><em>By Lights and Lens</em></p>
        
        <p>Photography isn’t just about pressing the shutter — it’s about capturing a moment, telling a story, and evoking emotion. With the right techniques, anyone can take stunning photographs, even without expensive equipment.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Focus on Lighting</h3>
        <p>Light is the single most important element in photography. Natural light during golden hour (shortly after sunrise or before sunset) can create warm, flattering tones that make your subject glow.</p>

        <h3>2. Master Composition</h3>
        <p>Follow the rule of thirds by imagining your frame divided into a 3x3 grid. Place your subject where the lines intersect for a balanced and engaging shot.</p>

        <h3>3. Pay Attention to the Background</h3>
        <p>A cluttered background can distract from your subject. Use a shallow depth of field to blur the background, keeping the focus on what matters most.</p>

        <h3>4. Experiment with Angles</h3>
        <p>Get creative! Shoot from high above, down low, or from unusual perspectives to give your photos a unique touch.</p>

        <p>With these simple steps, you can transform your photos from snapshots into works of art. Remember — practice is key. The more you shoot, the more your style will develop.</p>
